## Description
This project is a short JavaScript quiz game. Rather than focusing on the actual questions working on this project I was trying to learn how to functions and design works together. This quiz project helped to learn fundamentals and more complex funcions and elements of JavaScript language. Also it expanded my understanding of how .html, .css and .js files contribute together in order to accomplish required tasks in the project. Working on this project I realized how complex it can get to debug a problem and find a solution to work arround. This project also helped me to learn more about the use of chrome 'inspect' tool and how helpful it is to find the issues.
